# Grocery eCommerce Website

This repository contains the source code for a **Grocery-based eCommerce Website**, which allows users to browse and purchase grocery items online. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end is powered by PHP and connects to a MySQL database for storing product, user, and order information.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Product Listings**: Users can view a variety of grocery items, including detailed descriptions, prices, and stock availability.
- **Shopping Cart**: Customers can add products to their cart, modify quantities, and view the total price.
- **Checkout Process**: Users can place orders, choose shipping methods, and make payments (integration with a payment gateway could be added).
- **Order History**: Registered users can view their past orders and their statuses.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage products, view orders, and update the website content.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Other Tools**: Bootstrap (for responsive design), jQuery (for JavaScript functionalities)

4. **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage products (add, edit, delete) and view customer orders from the admin panel (this could be an area you want to implement if it’s not done yet).

## Customization

If you want to customize or expand the functionality of the website, here are a few suggestions:

- **Payment Gateway Integration**: You could integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle payments.
- **Product Filters**: Add filters for sorting products by price, category, and rating.
- **Responsive Design**: The website uses Bootstrap, but you can further refine the layout for mobile users.
